# Project 2: Designing and Optimizing a Reliable Data Transmission Protocol

The goal of this project is to design and implement a reliable transfer protocol that achieves high goodput and low overhead under diverse network conditions. The project will be evaluated based on the kinds of optimizations implemented, the achieved performance, and a report documenting the performance of the scheme under different network conditions. The project requires implementing a baseline scheme for comparison, and testing the code with provided configuration files. The submission should include the directories corresponding to protocols implemented and a report based on the provided template. It is important not to modify the Emulator, Monitor, or the provided test configurations. The project will be graded based on the correctness of the file transmission using the implemented protocols, as well as the clarity of the report and the effort and creativity in adding optimizations. The grade reflected in grade.txt file is not the final grade, and the final grade is based on a combination of the report and the implementation.
